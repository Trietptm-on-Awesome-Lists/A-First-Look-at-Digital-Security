========

- **Ad-tracking** - When we browse the web, we can be tracked by many different
  entities: a lot of websites sell our data to advertising companies by
  installing small pieces of code that observe our browsing behaviour and keep
  track of our activities all over the web. Learn more about how web trackers
  work and how you can avoid been tracked in [this
  website](https://myshadow.org/browser-tracking).
- **Anonymity** - A term that generally refers to situations where an author or
  artist prefers not to connect their work to their official name, in the
  internet anonymity is a condition where a user can hide their identity,
  location, and other identifying details while [connecting to the
  web](https://hygiene.digitalpublicsquare.com/I_want_to_be_anonymous_connecting_to_the_web/),
  [browsing
  websites](https://hygiene.digitalpublicsquare.com/I_want_to_be_anonymous_when_browsing_the_web/),
  [sending
  emails](https://hygiene.digitalpublicsquare.com/I_want_to_send_an_anonymous_email/),
  [chatting](https://hygiene.digitalpublicsquare.com/Id_like_to_have_an_anonymous_conversation/),
  sharing files, etc. Different from pseudonymity (the use of a nickname, alias
  or handle other than one's official name), anonymity online requires the
  deployment of [tools and
  tactics](https://hygiene.digitalpublicsquare.com/Identity_or_Location/) which
  can hide the user's IP address, client settings, and other features that could
  lead to their identification.
- **Browser Extensions** - A browser extension is a piece of software that can
  be added to a browser to extend its functionality. Some of these extensions
  have been created to enhance users' privacy. [Here's a
  guide](https://myshadow.org/prevent-online-tracking) on some of the most
  useful extensions we can use to protect your privacy.
- **Censorship Circumvention** - A website or web service may be unreachable
  from our location due to internet filtering or other forms of blockage or
  censorship implemented in our local network, by our ISP or countrywide.
  Accessing the world wide web despite these blockages or filters is possible
  through tools for censorship circumvention. To learn more about all the
  possibilities we can use, read [this
  page](https://hygiene.digitalpublicsquare.com/I_want_to_learn_about_circumventing_Internet_censorship),
  with links to many guides and tools.
- **Chat History** - By default, many chat and instant messaging tools and
  services keep a history of all our conversations. Should someone access our
  device or account, they would be able to read all our conversations even if we
  use encryption. It is therefore a good idea to tweak the settings in our
  client, app or account so that our chat history is deleted when we close our
  conversation or after a set period of time.
- **Defacement** - A website defacement is an attack on a website that changes
  its appearance or content. Defacement is often used to spread political
  messages against the organization that runs the targeted website.
- **Diceware Method** - Strong passphrases usually consist of a string of
  characters that includes lower- and upper-case letters, numbers and symbols.
  This kind of passphrases is generally hard to remember, and even if they can
  be stored in a password manager, a passphrase is still needed to unlock the
  password manager itself. So how to remember that passphrase while keeping it
  secure? The Diceware method helps with this: passphrases generated with this
  method consist of 5 or 6 random words separated by spaces. Since blank spaces
  are a character themselves, this way we will have long passphrases with
  letters and symbols that are very difficult to crack. To generate a diceware
  passphrase we just need 5 dice, a piece of paper and a [list of words like
  this](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarewordlist.pdf). Read [this
  article](https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/)
  to find out more about the Diceware method.
- **Email Encryption** - Emails can be compared to simple postcards, as they can
  be read by anyone who has access to the servers of our email providers.
  Unlike postcards, though, they are stored in several copies in many different
  servers, so the possibility of someone reading them is even higher, not to
  mention that some services analyze the content of our email for their targeted
  ads. To protect our communications, we can encrypt our messages using
  [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) (often called GPG), a tool that turns our email
  into a long line of gibberish that can only be decrypted by the person/s we're
  writing to. Using GPG is easier with a tool like
  [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net) for
  [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/), but whatever
  software we use, we should keep in mind that we can encrypt our emails only if
  the people we are writing to have already set up GPG on their computer. You
  can read more about email encryption in [this
  guide](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication/#encrypting-and-authenticating-individual-messages)
  or in the official [GnuPG guide](https://gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html).
- **Encrypted Chat** - As with email, also with chat and instant messaging
  anyone who has access to the servers of our chat provider could read our
  conversations as well as our chat history, if we haven't set our client to
  delete it automatically. But as with email, we can encrypt our chat so that it
  appears as an obscure string of characters to all but the person/s we're
  chatting with. There are several tools for encrypting chat communications, for
  example
  [OTR](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication/#securing-your-instant-messaging-software) -
  which can be used for Jabber/XMPP or IRC with a variety of clients, like
  [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/), [Adium](https://adium.im/),  or [Tor
  Messenger](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-messenger-beta-chat-over-tor-easily) -
  or [OMEMO](https://conversations.im/omemo/) - which  also encrypts group chat,
  but is currently implemented only in the Android XMPP-Client
  [Conversations](https://conversations.im/), the iOS client
  [ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org/), or as a plugin for the desktop client
  [Gajim](https://gajim.org/).
- **Encrypted File Sharing** - There are many options to share files with
  our friends and colleagues, but few offer reliable solutions to make sure that
  our files are only accessed by the people we meant to share them with.  When
  deciding how to share files securely, we should check that the encryption
  takes place before it leaves our computer (end-to-end encryption) and that the
  web service we're using for storage does not have access to our encryption
  key.
- **Encrypted Instant Messenger** - *See* ***Encrypted Chat***
- **Encrypted Messaging and Voice Apps** - To protect our phone communications,
  there are several options we can use for encrypting both texting and voice,
  for example [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/). Of all these, one in
  particular, [Signal](https://signal.org/), offers end-to-end encryption both
  for messages, group chat and phone calls, is open source, has been audited for
  security and stores very few metadata. Signal is an Android, iOS and desktop
  app. To sign up, a phone number is needed, and encrypted communication is only
  possible with contacts who have set it up in their smartphones too.
- **Encryption** - Encryption is the process of encoding data in such a way that
  only authorized parties can access them. When we talk about encryption in this
  booklet, we always mean
  [asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography),
  [end-to-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption)
  cryptography, where only the sender and receivers of the messages can decrypt
  the messages or files and no third-party controls the cryptographic keys. You
  can read more on encryption in [this guide](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/what-encryption).
- **FDE** - *See* ***Full-Disk Encryption***
- **Full-Disk Encryption (FDE)** - Encrypting sensitive files is always a good
  idea, but it is even better to encrypt our whole hard disk, because if someone
  gets control of our computer or external hard drive, they will be able to see
  all the unencrypted data we have stored there, which might not be highly
  sensitive, but can still be very private. Be it for personal computers or
  mobile devices, every operating system offers an option for full-disk
  encryption, but remember that the device will be encrypted only when it's
  switched off. You can read more about how to keep your data safe through
  full-disk encryption
  [here](https://ssd.eff.org/en/playlist/human-rights-defender#keeping-your-data-safe).
- **Identity** - A complex connection between our body, documents, activities
  and social roles in the physical world, in the internet - also thanks to the
  existence of anonymizing tools - our identity can be more fluid and we can
  create many different identities that build a reputation of their own through
  their actions. You can read more on how to securely manage your official and
  virtual identities online in [this
  manual](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/Step_1).
- **Online Persona** - An online persona is a full-fledged, credible identity
  with a name, email address, and personally identifying traits that can be
  completely different from the features that characterize the physical person
  who has created that persona. Read more on online personas
  [here](https://gendersec.tacticaltech.org/wiki/index.php/Step_1#Creating_a_credible_persona).
- **Password Manager** - Password managers are tools for storing passphrases
  securely, so that no unauthorized person can access them. By using an open
  source password manager, we can create and store unique and strong passwords
  for each of our accounts or tools without having to memorize them. Read more
  about password managers in [this
  tutorial](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/passwords/#recording-passwords-securely).
- **Privacy** - Privacy online is the freedom to choose who can access which
  information about us. Unfortunately, commercial web services keep a lot of
  our personal data, and their privacy policies are long documents in legalese
  that we tend to accept without really reading them. [Terms of Service Didn't
  Read](https://tosdr.org/) is a project that helps us understand the terms of
  service of the websites we visit and rates each one based on the respect of
  our privacy. You can learn more about how to control your data in [this
  website](https://myshadow.org/increase-your-privacy).
- **Short URLs** - When we click on a shortened link, for example a bit.ly link,
  we can't know what web page we're going to open: it may be a legitimate
  website, but it might also be an attempt at infecting our computer or a
  phishing web page, so it's always a good idea to check where a shortened URL
  leads to before we click on it. Fortunately there are several web services and
  browser extensions that can help us, expanding the URL so that we can check
  what we're going to open, or offering a preview of the page linked through the
  shortened URL.
- **Secure Connections** - When we visit a website by entering a common URL
  starting with http://, our logins and passwords and other confidential data
  can be intercepted. To prevent this risk, many websites offer the possibility
  of accessing them securely, by entering a URL that starts with https:// -
  where the 's' stands for 'secure'. We can do this manually, but it can be even
  more convenient to install a [browser
  extension](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) that secures our connections
  whenever possible. To make sure that our connections are secure also when we
  read our email or chat through a client, we should always check that the
  TLS/SSL option is activated in our connection settings.
- **Security Checkup** - Facebook, Google and other web services offer their
  users a security checkup interface to review all their settings and check that
  their account is secured from attacks aimed at unauthorized access or hacking.
  To make sure that your account is secure, log in, go to the account settings
  and start your checkup.
- **Software Updates** - Software is developed continuously - be it Windows,
  your favorite videogame, or a component that makes your smartphone run, its
  developers always identify new vulnerabilities or bugs and get rid of them in
  the newer versions of the software. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by
  hackers to attack us with malware, ransomware and other malicious pieces of
  code. That's why it's so important to enable automatic updates of our
  operating system and software whenever possible and to avoid old unmaintained
  systems like Windows XP.
- **Strong Password** - A password is strong if it contains at least 20
  characters, including lower- and upper-case letters, numbers and symbols.
  To learn more about how to generate and maintain strong password, read [this
  tutorial](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/passwords/). *See also*
  ***Diceware Method***.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2fa)** - When we log into a device or an online
  account, we need to verify our identity. Most of the time, we enter a user
  name and a password. Unfortunately, a password alone isn't very secure: it
  can be guessed or we could be observed by someone while we're entering it. It
  is therefore always a good idea to use two-factor  authentication, a solution
  that requires both something we know (like a passphrase) and something we own
  (for example a smartphone with a code-generating app) to access our account.
  Read this guide on [two-factor
  authentication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CyDaDNuLT3y3GjPZPRS_3KuXBuyjzJo8wyvTXZhBOOg/edit
  update link when published) to learn about the best practices to secure your
  account through 2fa.
- **Unprotected Wi-Fi** - Free public wi-fi hotspots are increasingly available
  in public spaces, and we tend to use them often, especially when we are
  traveling. But if a wi-fi is open, it is also unencrypted, and malicious
  actors could sniff on our connection to intercept our activities and
  passwords.  There are however simple measures we can take to protect
  ourselves, like connecting to the internet through a trusted VPN.
- **Untrusted Wi-Fi** - *See* ***Unprotected Wi-Fi***
- **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** - A Virtual Private Network is a network we
  can access to connect to the Internet via an encrypted tunnel. Our ISP, or
  anyone sniffing on the free wi-fi we're using to access the web, can only see
  our connection to the VPN service, while the website we are visiting will
  only record a connection from the VPN servers. To decide which is the best VPN
  for you, read [this
  guide](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/choosing-vpn-thats-right-you).
