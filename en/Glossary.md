- **Anonymity** - Generally connected to situations where an author or artist
  prefers not to connect their work with their official name, in the internet
  anonymity is a condition in which a user can hide their identity, location and
  other identifying details while browsing the web, communicating, sharing
  files, etc.  Different from pseudonymity (the use of a nickname, alias or
  handle different from one's official name), anonymity online requires the
  usage of tools like the [Tor Browser](https://torproject.org) that can hide
  the user's IP address, client settings, and other features that could lead to
  their identification.
- **Browser Extensions** - A browser extension is a piece of software that can
  be added to a browser to extend its functionality. Some of these extensions
  have been created to enhance users' privacy. [Here's a
  guide](https://myshadow.org/prevent-online-tracking) on some of the most
  useful extensions you can use to protect your privacy.
- **Censorship Circumvention** - A website or web service may be unreachable
  from your location due to Internet filtering or other forms of blockage or
  censorship implemented in your local network, by your ISP or countrywide.
  Accessing the world wide web despite these blockages or filters is possible
  through tools for censorship circumvention. To learn more about all the
  possibilities we can use, read [this
  page](https://hygiene.digitalpublicsquare.com/I_want_to_learn_about_circumventing_Internet_censorship),
  with links to many guides and tools.
- **Chat History** - By default, many chat and instant messaging tools and
  services keep a history of all your conversations. Should someone access your
  device or your account, they could read all your chat conversations even if
  they were encrypted. It is therefore a good idea to tweak the settings in your
  client, app or account so that your chat history is deleted when you close
  your conversation or after a set period of time.
- **Defacement** - A website defacement is an attack on a website that changes
  its appearance or content. Defacement is often used to spread political
  messages against the organization that runs the targeted website.
- **Diceware Method** - Strong passphrases usually consist of a string of
  characters that includes lower- and upper-case letters, numbers and symbols.
  This kind of passphrases is generally hard to remember, and even if they can
  be stored in a password manager, a passphrase is still needed to unlock the
  password manager itself. So how to remember that passphrase while keeping it
  strong? The Diceware method helps with this: passphrase generated with this
  method consist of 5 or 6 random words separated by spaces. Since blank spaces
  are a character themselves, this way you will have very long passphrase with
  letters and symbols that is very difficult to crack. To generate a diceware
  passphrase you just need 5 dice, a piece of paper and a [list of words like
  this](http://world.std.com/~reinhold/dicewarewordlist.pdf). Read [this
  article](https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/)
  to find out more about the Diceware method.
- **Email Encryption** - Emails can be compared to simple postcards, as they can
  be read by anyone who has access to the servers of your email providers.
  Unlike postcards, they are also stored in several copies in many different
  servers, so the possibility of someone reading them is even higher, not to
  mention that some services analyze the content of your email for their
  targeted ads. To protect your communications securely, you can encrypt your
  messages using GPG, a tool that turns your email into a long line of gibberish
  that can only be decrypted by the person you're writing to. You can use GPG
  with a tool like [Enigmail](https://www.enigmail.net) for
  [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/), but only to
  communicate with people who have already set up GPG on their computer. You can
  read more about email encryption in [this
  guide](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication/#encrypting-and-authenticating-individual-messages)
  or in the official [GnuPG guide](https://gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html).
- **Encrypted Chat** - As with email, also with chat and instant messaging
  anyone who has access to the computers of your chat provider could read your
  conversations as well as your chat history if you haven't set your client to
  delete it automatically. But as with email, you can encrypt your chat so that
  it will appear as an obscure string of characters to all but the person/s
  you're chatting with. There are several tools for encrypting chat
  communications. You can choose between
  [OTR](https://securityinabox.org/en/guide/secure-communication/#securing-your-instant-messaging-software)
  - that can be used for Jabber/XMPP or IRC with a variety of clients, like
  [Pidgin](https://pidgin.im/), [Adium](https://adium.im/),  or [Tor
  Messenger](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-messenger-beta-chat-over-tor-easily)
  - [OMEMO](https://conversations.im/omemo/) - which is currently implemented
  only in the Android XMPP-Client [Conversations](https://conversations.im/),
  the iOS client [ChatSecure](https://chatsecure.org/), or as a plugin for the
  Desktop client [Gajim](https://gajim.org/).
- Encrypted Document Sharing - 
- Encrypted Instant Messenger - *See Encrypted Chat*
- Encrypted Texting and Voice Apps - To protect your phone communications, there are several options you can use both for texting and voice, for example [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/). Of all these, one in particular, [Signal](https://signal.org/), offers end-to-end encryption both for messages, group chat and phone calls, is open source, has been audited for security and doesnâ€™t store any message metadata. Signal is an Android, iOS and desktop app. To sign up, you need a phone number, and to use it your friends have to set it up in their smartphones too.
- Encryption - Encryption is the process of encoding data in such a way that only authorized parties can access them. When we talk about encryption in this booklet, we always mean [asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), [end-to-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption) cryptography, where only the sender and receiver of the messages can decrypt the messages and no third-party controls the decryption keys.
